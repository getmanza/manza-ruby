    # API-initiated transfers, called payments (formerly transfer drafts;
    # `/api/transfer_drafts` stays a permanent server-side alias). Creating
    # a draft never executes a transfer by itself. A draft inside the
    # entity's machine-
    # authorization envelope (trusted payee, within limits) is sent to
    # the enrolled transfer authorizer as a `payment.authorization_requested`
    # webhook; answer it with {#authorize} or {#decline}, using an API
    # key other than the one that created the draft. Every other draft
    # goes to the in-app approval flow, where a manager or legal
    # representative approves it. Poll {#get} (status: requested →
    # processing → completed / failed) or subscribe to the
    # `transfer.executed` webhook to follow execution.
    #
    # A draft's `authorization` says which way it went: `pending` (a
    # challenge was sent), `authorized`, `declined` (the draft is deleted),
    # or one of two outcomes that send the draft to the in-app approvers,
    # each with a `refusal_reason`:
    #
    # - `refused`: it did not qualify, at create time (no webhook is sent)
    #   or again when the challenge was answered: `untrusted_payee`,
    #   `unrestricted_api_key`, `over_new_payee_limit`,
    #   `over_transfer_limit`, `over_daily_limit`, `currency_mismatch`,
    #   `suspended` or `secret_expired`.
    # - `expired` / `superseded` / `failed`: a challenge was sent and closed
    #   without an authorize: `expired` (no answer within the hour),
    #   `stale` (the draft, its payee's bank details or the endpoint changed
    #   while it was open) or `signature_failed` (five invalid signatures).
    #   One exception: the in-app approval that finalizes the draft while
    #   its challenge is open supersedes it (`stale`), and the draft
    #   executes or is scheduled; the draft's own `status` shows which.
    #
    # `authorization` is nil when no authorizer was enrolled.
    #
    # With "Approve transfers to new payees" on (enrolment, in the app),
    # a draft to bank details the entity never trusted is challenged too,
    # up to the new-payee limit, when the creating key has an IP
    # allowlist; authorizing it also trusts the payee.
